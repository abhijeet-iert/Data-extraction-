This project focuses on the systematic extraction and aggregation of career and recruitment data from fragmented Government and Public Sector portals. The Challenge: The "Missing Link" in Public Sector Data
Finding genuine, up-to-date government job openings is a notorious challenge for developers and job seekers alike. Unlike the private sector, which leverages standardized APIs and SEO-optimized job boards, public sector data is often locked behind "Digital Fortresses."

Why is this data so hard to extract?
Legacy Architecture: Many government portals (e.g., individual PSU sites or state-level departments) still operate on legacy systems from the early 2000s. These sites often use non-standard HTML, lack metadata, and rely heavily on PDFs rather than structured text.

The "Anti-Scraping" Paradox: To prevent server overloads and maintain security, many official portals employ aggressive bot-detection and IP-blocking. Paradoxically, this makes it harder for legitimate data-aggregation tools to help citizens find jobs.

Fragmented Sources: There is rarely a "single source of truth." A single vacancy might be mentioned on a department's notice board, a regional employment exchange, and an official gazette—all with slight variations and no central linking.

Dynamic and Hidden Content: Many portals use JavaScript-heavy rendering or session-based navigation that hides job URLs from standard web crawlers.
